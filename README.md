# SoPra FS24 - GPTuessr

## Introduction

GPTuessr is an innovative online multiplayer game that blends the classic fun of drawing and guessing games with cutting-edge AI-driven art generation. Inspired by popular games like "skribbl", GPTuessr is designed to provide an engaging platform for groups of friends to connect and have fun remotely. At the heart of GPTuessr is the use of OpenAI's DALL-E, which generates real-time images based on players' descriptions, offering a unique twist to traditional hand-drawn approaches.
Our motivation stems from the exciting potential to merge art with technology, enhancing user experience by integrating advanced AI capabilities. The game features user authentication, dynamic lobby management, and intelligent game logic, all supported by the APIs of DALL-E and ChatGPT. As a web application, GPTuessr ensures broad accessibility and ease of use across various devices, facilitating seamless real-time communication and interaction among players. This project not only aims to entertain but also to pioneer new ways of experiencing art and gaming in a digital landscape.

## High-level components

### Image Generation

The [image generation view](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-32/sopra-fs24-group-32-client/blob/main/src/components/views/GameCreate.tsx) is only shown to the player whose turn it is to generate the image with DAll-E in each round. In this view, the "creator" can enter an image description for an image that he wants to create.

### Description Guessing

The [description guessing view](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-32/sopra-fs24-group-32-client/blob/main/src/components/views/GameGuess.tsx) is shown to all other players except the image creator. In this view once the image is created in the [image generation view](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-32/sopra-fs24-group-32-client/blob/main/src/components/views/GameCreate.tsx) by the "creator" the image than gets displayed to the users that have a specific time limit (set in the [lobby settings](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-32/sopra-fs24-group-32-client/blob/main/src/components/views/LobbyCreate.tsx)) to guess the correct image description.

### Scoreboard

The [scoreboard view](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-32/sopra-fs24-group-32-client/blob/main/src/components/views/Scoreboard.tsx) is displayed to all players after each creation and guessing turn. In the scoreboard the correct image description is revealed and the players see the points they received and the other guesses and points of the players in the lobby.

## Launch & Deployment

Before you start your application for the first time, run this command to install all other dependencies, including React:

`npm install`

Next, you can start the app with:

`npm run dev`

Make sure you also started the application in the backend. For this view the README.md file in the [server](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-32/sopra-fs24-group-32-server)

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use a Chrome-based browser)

The deployed webapplication on Google Cloud can be found here: [https://sopra-fs24-group-32-client.oa.r.appspot.com/](https://sopra-fs24-group-32-client.oa.r.appspot.com/)
